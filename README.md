I have taken a liking to data engineering as a career option. Having been in the data science field for just over 3 years now (Jan 2022), I learnt that there is a gap that needs to be attended to. 

This repo will serve as my portfolio of data engineering projects that I will be doing to not only show off my skills but learn more about this field as I go deeper into it.
